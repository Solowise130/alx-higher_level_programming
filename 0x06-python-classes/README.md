This project focuses on Python Classes and Objects with specific emphasis on OOPS, Object oriented programming, Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding.
The files executes the following functions;

0 - Writes an empty class Square that defines a square.
1 - Writes a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 0-square.py)
2 - Writes a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 1-square.py)
3 - Writes a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 2-square.py) 
4 - Writes a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 3-square.py)
5 - Writes a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 4-square.py)
6 - Writes a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 5-square.py)
100 - Writes a class Node that defines a node of a singly linked list by:

Private instance attribute: data:
property def data(self): to retrieve it
property setter def data(self, value): to set it:
data must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message data must be an integer
Private instance attribute: next_node:
property def next_node(self): to retrieve it
property setter def next_node(self, value): to set it:
next_node can be None or must be a Node, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message next_node must be a Node object
Instantiation with data and next_node: def __init__(self, data, next_node=None):
And, write a class SinglyLinkedList that defines a singly linked list by:

Private instance attribute: head (no setter or getter)
Simple instantiation: def __init__(self):
Should be printable:
print the entire list in stdout
one node number by line
Public instance method: def sorted_insert(self, value): that inserts a new Node into the correct sorted position in the list (increasing order)

101 - Writes a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 6-square.py).
102 - Writes a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 4-square.py).
103 - Writes the Python class MagicClass that does exactly the same as a given Python bytecode.
