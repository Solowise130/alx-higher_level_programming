This project focuses on Python - Inheritance, with emphasis on isinstance, issubclass, type and super built-in functions.
All the  test files are inside the "tests" folder.
Below are the files and the expected function outputs.

0-lookup.py - Writes a function that returns the list of available attributes and methods of an object. Prototype: def lookup(obj).

1-my_list.py - Writes a class MyList that inherits from list. Prototype: def print_sorted(self)

2-is_same_class.py - Writes - a function that returns True if the object is exactly an instance of the specified class ; otherwise False. Prototype: def is_same_class(obj, a_class).

3-is_kind_of_class.py - Writes a function that returns True if the object is an instance of, or if the object is an instance of a class that inherited from, the specified class ; otherwise False. Prototype: def is_kind_of_class(obj, a_class).

4-inherits_from.py - Writes  a function that returns True if the object is an instance of a class that inherited (directly or indirectly) from the specified class ; otherwise False. Prototype: def inherits_from(obj, a_class).

5-base_geometry.py - Writes an empty class BaseGeometry.

6-base_geometry.py - Writes a class BaseGeometry (based on 5-base_geometry.py).

7-base_geometry.py - Writes a class BaseGeometry (based on 6-base_geometry.py). Prototype: def integer_validator(self, name, value).

8-rectangle.py - Writes a class Rectangle that inherits from BaseGeometry (7-base_geometry.py).

9-rectangle.py - Writes a class Rectangle that inherits from BaseGeometry (7-base_geometry.py). (task based on 8-rectangle.py).

10-square.py - Writes a class Square that inherits from Rectangle (9-rectangle.py).

11-square.py - Writes a class Square that inherits from Rectangle (9-rectangle.py). (task based on 10-square.py).

100-my_int.py - Writes  a class MyInt that inherits from int:

101-add_attribute.py - Writes a function that adds a new attribute to an object if it’s possible:Raise a TypeError exception, with the message can't add new attribute if the object can’t have new attribute.
